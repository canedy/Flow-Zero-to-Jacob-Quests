1. Can you brainstorm any ways to distribute Minters to other people WITHOUT having to have 2 signers, or in other words, 2 AuthAccounts? If you can't that is okay. But try your best to come up with something. We will learn this later down the road as well.

   - You can set it up so that only the admin can mint and then have a process to give the NFT to each user. So thinking you can assign an admin that is not just the contract owner. Then you could mint NFT based on your need then build a process that will allow a user or admin to move it from one collection to another collection.
