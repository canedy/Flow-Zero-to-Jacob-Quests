1. **What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?** Safety and Security - It attempts to protect the program and, by default, protect the users of Smart Contract development from making mistakes in their coding. It is a strongly typed language with features unique to Smart Contract development as resources. 
- Clarity - allows developers to understand the code they are developing and editing quickly. Anyone new to the language can quickly pick up the Flow of creating code easier and make development approachable. 
- Approachability - Anyone with some programming experience can pick up the coding syntax in no time. So new and old alike can start creating Smart Contracts from the first lesson.
- Developer Experience - This is important because developing a Smart Contract incorrectly can lead to awful outcomes. Making the developer experience as straightforward as possible will allow them to spend time auditing and testing their code effectively. 
- Resource-Oriented Programming - This programming style has been around for many decades. At its core, it's the ability for digital assets (code) to mimic a real-world asset. It allows a programmer to code that certain code functions can own an asset. In Flow, it says that a resource can not be owned more than once and must either be saved or destroyed when used. 

2. **In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful.** 
- Safety and Security protects the developer and end-user from badly written contracts
- Clarity provides a clear understanding of what you are reading and can help the end-user understand the execution of the code.
- Approachability allows anyone new or old to Flow blockchain to pick up the code because it's readable and explicit in how it executes.
- Developer Experience - Cadence works like many other typed languages that help write what you mean to right without many interpretations. 
- Resource-Oriented Programming - For me, it goes back to why you create NFTs in the first place. You write them to represent some physical asset. To protect that resource, you want to guarantee that you are writing code in a way that will not get lost. As you write more complex smart contracts, this concept will become necessary.
